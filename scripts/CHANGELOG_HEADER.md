# [SEE RELEASES INSTEAD](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/releases)

We use GitHub's releases tab to log our changes in detail, but this
auto-generated changelog helps us to produce that list, and it may be helpful
to you also.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: most of the changes in PostGraphile actually come from
Graphile Engine, so you should also reference [those
changes](https://github.com/graphile/graphile-engine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
